# Backend API 

To run the backend server : 

* Make sure you have the latest version of nodejs
* Move into the backend folder
* Run `npm install` if you haven't already
* Run `npm start` to start the server. 

For development, we use `nodemon`.
* Run `npm run dev` inside the backend folder.  
That will allow you to perform code changes and automatically reload the server. 

>>Â PS: The scripts allow for a port parameter. You can run the server on any port adding **-p**. Example: `npm start -p 3001` will start the server on port 3001
