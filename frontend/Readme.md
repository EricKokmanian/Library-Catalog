# Frontend

To run the frontend application : 

* Move into the frontend folder
* Run `npm install` if you haven't already
* Run `npm start` to start the dev server. 

This will start the server and open the browser at http://localhost:3001
React's dev server allows you to perform code changes and automatically reload the web-page. 

>>Â PS: The frontend application expects a backend server running on port **3000** to work properly.
